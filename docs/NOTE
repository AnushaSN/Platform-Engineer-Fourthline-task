Some Notes and Improvement points:

NOTE:
- Working on main branch, as i am the only person working in repo. Once teams start using the repo, main/master branch commits should be via PR only, as they will be deployed in production.
- The kubeconfig file is right now added in repo for ease of access for the team to verify the assignment. But the kubeconfig shouldnt be put in repo , but obatined by the user:
