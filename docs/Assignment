What is to be done?
1 Deploy an EKS, K8s cluster into AWS acc, in eu-west-1 availablity zone - Using terraform 
2 fork the given repo and follow instructions in README to modify and deploy a stateless app in the EKS cluster created using HELM

  Objectives:
  - goal is to deploy the included application (under app/) to the EKS cluster you have created using the provided, rudimentary Dockerfile and Helm chart, in a namespace named as your firstname while also completing the following objectives.
  - Enable HPA for the deployment and set the target utilization to 80% for CPU and 85% for memory.
  - Set CPU request to 150m.
  - Make the application highly available.
  - Expose the application via a service to the cluster.
  - Expose the application to the internet. You may use the Route53 zone that has already been created in the provided AWS account, in region eu-west-1.
  - Make the application's index page show Hello {GREET_VAR} instead of "Hello world", where GREET_VAR is an environment variable. The variable should get its value from the values.yaml file.
  - Fix the provided Dockerfile, so it runs the application on startup.


3 Deploy a stateful app on the EKS 

Ground rules:
- Use the AWS acc provided
- Repo should be private
- make it reusable
- must be in terraform

to be delivered:
- link to repo with documentation
- creds for EKS
- work log
- any improvement/suggestions/ points that could not be worked on in the given timeframe
